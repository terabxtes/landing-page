# House of Olympus & Underworld

This is a completed landing page project inspired by The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum. The project challenged students to recreate a modern, clean layout while incorporating custom styling and themes. This version reimagines the layout as a mythology-based portal blending gods, legends, and immersive visuals.

- HTML5
- CSS3 (embedded)

## 🌌 Theme
A mythological experience featuring Mount Olympus and the Underworld:
