# Landing-page - House of Olympus

This is my solution to The Odin Project's Landing Page project. The goal is to build a fully structured and styled landing page using HTML and CSS.

## Project Goals

- Practice semantic HTML structure
- Use CSS for layout and spacing
- Apply flexbox to build a responsive layout
- Reinforce visual hierarchy and clean design

## Current Status

- ✅ HTML structure complete  
- ⏳ CSS styling to be added next

## Live Preview

_Open `index.html` in your browser_  
_(or use Live Server in VS Code)_
